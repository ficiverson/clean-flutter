# cleanflutter

A new Flutter project with a demo of clean architecture to list users from network, local storage or both. Also I provide some examples using custom views and animations.

Thanks to [alessandroaime](https://github.com/alessandroaime/Weather/blob/master/lib/header_painter.dart) for this awesome canvas background to show the sample.
